# PythonProject--GenderPayGap
 
This project was part of the Code First Girls Introduction to Python Programming course (February-March 2021), for which my team and I won the Course Excellence Certificate. 

We wrote Python code to analyse a dataset on the gender pay gap at Glassdoor (dataset from Kaggle).

My contribution to the project can be found under pythonProject > venv > gender pay.py

I analysed the average pay of men and women at each educational level in order to assess the gender pay gap in more detail. I used seaborn and matplotlib to draw graphs displaying the results. 

We worked well as a team, dividing tasks but also working on problems and discussing the code together.
